    "description": "<p>The Kodagu district of Karnataka is famous for its coffee plantations, lush greenery, picturesque surroundings, rich flora and fauna and the native tribes that inhabit the region. A very popular hill station, Coorg paints a pretty picture of the grandeur of nature. Nestled in the thickly canopied Western Ghats, the district is home to the native speakers of the Kodava language. Coorg is a hilly region where the elevation varies between 3,000 feet and 5,740 feet. The highest point is the peak of the Tadiyandamol which is a popular trekking destination. The second highest point is the Pushpagiri -- another popular trekking destination.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Coorg also has a number of local attraction to its credit. The most prominent amongst them include the tibetan settlement of Bylakuppe, Omkareshwara temple in Madikeri, and the picnic spot of cauvery nisargadhama.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The River Cauvery is the main river of the Coorg district. It is home to several tribal communities including the Airi, Male Kudiya, Thatta, Kembatti etc. The natives of Coorg worship arms and weapons. Their attire is distinctive and quite attractive. The men wear long knee length coats known as Kupyas over full sleeved shirts. A gold coloured sash called Chale is worn over the Kupya and a silver knife called Peechekath is tucked into it. The other items that go with the ensemble include a knife called the Odikathi and a small gun with a dagger hanging from it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Being a part of the Western Ghats, Coorg is rich in flora and fauna. It has three wildlife sanctuaries – the Talakaveri, Pushpagiri and Brahmagiri Wildlife Sanctuaries- and one national park, the Nagarhole National Park. Some of the animal species found in these wildlife parks include the Asiatic elephant, tigers, leopards and wild boars.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The nearest railheads to Coorg are the Kannur and Mysore railway stations. The nearest airports are the Mysore Airport and the Mangalore International Airport. Madikeri in Coorg is well connected by three Ghat roads.</p>",
